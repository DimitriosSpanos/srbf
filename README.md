# Leveraging Subclass Learning for Improving Uncertainty Estimation in Deep Learning
In this repository we show models of the proposed method using subclass learning to improve uncertainty estimation, as described in our paper, which are capable of increasing the AUROC metric that describes the capability of a model to estimate uncertainty and reject out of domain samples.

Download tiny-imagenet dataset and the "tiny_imagenet.pth" from https://drive.google.com/file/d/141_bHobWPR2abbd5QP5Epa_pkSJqOvMk/view?usp=sharing
and run:
  ```bash
   python3 show_models.py
```
Full code of the implementation is being prepared and will be available soon.
